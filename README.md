# Sensorvalue-Blynk-ESP32
This project demonstrates how to read analog sensor data using an ESP32 and send the data to the Blynk app for real-time monitoring. The data is read from an analog sensor (e.g., temperature sensor, light sensor) connected to GPIO 34 and sent to the Blynk app via a virtual pin.

## Features
- Reads analog sensor data using ESP32.
- Sends sensor data to the Blynk app in real time.
- Customizable update interval with BlynkTimer.
- Serial debugging for real-time monitoring.

## Hardware Requirements
- ESP32 DevKit
- Analog sensor (e.g., temperature sensor, potentiometer, etc.)
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard (optional)
- USB cable for programming and power

## Software Requirements
- Arduino IDE
- Blynk Library
- Blynk app (iOS or Android)
- ESP32 Board package installed in the Arduino IDE
- 
## Blynk Setup
- Use V1 virtual pin

## Circuit Diagram

- Connect the **analog sensor**'s signal pin to GPIO 34 (or another analog input pin).
- Power the sensor with **3.3V** (or as per your sensor's requirements).
- Ground the sensor using **GND** on the ESP32.

## Installation

1. Install the [Blynk Library](https://github.com/blynkkk/blynk-library) in your Arduino IDE.
2. Install the [ESP32 Board Package](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32).
3. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone "https://github.com/Iam-Madman/Sensorvalue-Blynk-ESP32"
